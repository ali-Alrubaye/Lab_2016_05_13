                To create the ocean creatures lorem ipsum generator I took a long list of fish, sharks,
                whales, plants and more and used our list randomizer to continually mix them up.
                I then used javascript to place them into paragraph and list form with punctuation included to make the dummy
                text look like true sentences. There's also a few fictional ocean friends in there. See if you can spot them.
                Please feel free to use the ocean creatures lorem ipsum generator as well as our many others to
                get your boring filler text in your designs, templates, themes, books or anything else you need swimming along.
                If you are curious about the list of words I used I listed them below.
