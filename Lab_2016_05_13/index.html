            <p class="post-content">
                Animals are multicellular, eukaryotic organisms of the kingdom Animalia
                (also called Metazoa). All animals are motile, meaning they can move spontaneously and independently,
                at some point in their lives. Their body plan eventually becomes fixed as they develop, although some
                undergo a process of metamorphosis later on in their lives. All animals are heterotrophs: they must
                ingest other organisms or their products for sustenance.
                Most known animal phyla appeared in the fossil record as marine species during the Cambrian explosion, about 542 million years ago. Animals are divided into various sub-groups, some of which are: vertebrates (birds, mammals, amphibians, reptiles, fish); molluscs (clams, oysters, octopuses, squid, snails); arthropods (millipedes, centipedes, insects, spiders, scorpions, crabs, lobsters,
                shrimp); annelids (earthworms, leeches); cnidarians (jellyfish, anemones, corals); and sponges.
