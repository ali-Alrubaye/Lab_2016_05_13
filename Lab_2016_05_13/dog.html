                Choosing a purebred is the best way to know what a
                dog's looks and personality might be like, but it's never a guarantee

                Even within breeds there's enormous variety in the way a dog acts and reacts to
                the world around him. Those differences can be due to how much he was handled as
                a youngster, how well he was trained after bringing him home, and of course the
                genetic luck of the draw. In the end, your dog's preferences and personality are as
                individual as you are--and if you can accept that you're bound to enjoy each other.
